EIS01128,closed,Is the DFLAW approach designed to treat some of the tank waste from the Hanford Site?,"Direct Feed Low-Activity Waste (DFLAW)
The DFLAW approach will separate and pretreat some of the tank waste (approximately 23.5 million gallons) from certain underground tanks at the Hanford Site and immobilize (vitrify in a glass matrix) the pretreated LAW at the LAW Vitrification Facility. The DFLAW approach is a two-phased approach that will separate and pretreat supernate (essentially the upper-most layer of tank waste that contains low concentrations of long-lived radionuclides) from some of the Hanford tanks, to generate a LAW stream. Phase 1 of the DFLAW approach will entail the following: in-tank settling; separation (removal by decanting) of the supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids); filtration; and then cesium removal using ion exchange columns in a tank-side cesium removal (TSCR) unit. For Phase 2, DOE plans to treat additional supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids) using the same processes and will deploy either an additional TSCR unit or construct a filtration and cesium removal facility.

2. **Improved Emissions Controls:** Enhancements in emissions control technologies for transport vehicles, such as advanced catalysts or particulate filters, could further reduce harmful emissions during the transportation of secondary waste. 

3. **Regulatory Changes:** New policies that strengthen emissions standards for transport vehicles could drive changes in the composition of vehicular fleets or require modifications to existing fleets to meet stricter air quality objectives.

4. **Data Availability and Monitoring:** Advances in sensor technology and data analytics could improve the monitoring and real-time reporting of emissions associated with secondary waste transport, allowing for more precise assessment and management of air quality impacts.

5. **Integrated Traffic Management Systems:** Future transport policies might include more efficient routing and logistics planning, reducing idling and congestion-related emissions through coordinated transport systems or intelligent transport systems.

The Proposed Action would not involve the construction or operation of any facilities that have not been evaluated previously under NEPA or existing facilities that have not been licensed and permitted for air emissions by the applicable state regulatory agency. Therefore, the Proposed Action would not involve any new sources of facility air emissions at the Hanford Site, the offsite commercial treatment facilities, or any commercial disposal facilities. As identified in Section 2.1 of this SA, the TC&WM EIS assumed (under all alternatives) that the three onsite waste management locations (Central Waste Complex, Waste Receiving and Processing, and T-plant) were all expanded to provide a conservative evaluation of potential impacts since it was uncertain which facility would ultimately house the capability to treat and store all secondary waste. The potential emissions of criteria and toxic air pollutants associated with the construction, operation, and deactivation of these possible expansions are presented in Tables G-47 and G-48 in Appendix G of the TC&WM EIS. Greenhouse gases (GHG) are discussed in Section G.5 of the TC&WM EIS. The estimated emissions of carbon dioxide for Waste Management Alternative 2, which includes the expansion of these facilities, is presented in Table G-167 of the TC&WM EIS.
The transportation of secondary waste by truck to offsite treatment facilities and from the treatment facilities to a disposal site would generate vehicle emission pollutants, including GHG. Potential air quality emissions were evaluated in the TC&WM EIS (Appendix G) for each alternative for the construction, operation, deactivation, and closure project phases.22 These evaluations did not include offsite transportation of waste for treatment and disposal. To estimate the relative contribution of air emissions that include offsite transportation of secondary waste for treatment and disposal, DOE compared the transportation emissions of CO, nitrogen oxides, and GHGs to similar emissions for Tank Closure Alternative 2B during operations.","To estimate the relative contribution of air emissions, including offsite transportation of secondary waste for treatment and disposal, the Department of Energy (DOE) compared the emissions from the transportation of these wastes—specifically carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and greenhouse gases—to the emissions from similar operations under Tank Closure Alternative 2B. This approach allowed for a relative assessment of the impact of transporting waste versus onsite operations."

This assumption would result in the highest potential mass of container material (e.g., steel) per unit volume of cargo, thus limiting or reducing the allowable quantity of LLW and MLLW waste to be transported on any given shipment in order to comply with USDOT cargo limits (34,000 pounds for a tandem-axle trailer). The 55-gallon drums (or other USDOT-certified container) would be suitable for transportation in accordance with USDOT requirements and would meet all appropriate USDOT requirements for the transport of the subject wastes to PFNW, in accordance with 49 CFR Subchapter C.","The transportation of these wastes must comply with the regulations set forth by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), specifically outlined in 49 CFR Subchapter C.

DOE prepared this SA in accordance with 10 CFR 1021.314. The Proposed Action evaluated in the TC&WM EIS acknowledged that secondary waste could be managed through a combination of onsite and offsite treatment capabilities. The TC&WM EIS analyzed the disposal of grouted secondary waste at the IDF. DOE has been implementing a moderate amount of offsite treatment (an average of 73 to 145 cubic meters per year of dangerous waste and MLLW) and disposal since publication of the 2013 ROD. The increased volume of offsite treatment and disposal of LLW and MLLW under the Proposed Action evaluated in this SA would not represent a substantive change relevant to environmental concerns from the Proposed Action evaluated in the TC&WM EIS. The TC&WM EIS evaluated potential environmental impacts from the emission of criteria pollutants, toxic pollutants, and carbon dioxide.

EIS01323,recall,Why was Columbus AFB selected to be analyzed environmentally as the second installation for possible T-7A recapitalization?,"1.1.1.2 Why Columbus AFB?
In a Strategic Basing Decision Memorandum for Record dated February 16, 2018, the Secretary of the Air Force identified JBSA-Randolph as the preferred alternative and Columbus, Laughlin, Sheppard, and Vance AFBs as reasonable alternatives for T-7A recapitalization. DAF pilot training relies on a unique runway structure and special use airspace (SUA) capable of supporting high volume pilot training. As such, the potential locations for T-7A aircraft are limited to the five existing pilot training installations. DAF evaluated each of the five installations using criteria that included mission factors (e.g., weather and the ability to meet syllabus requirements), infrastructure capacity, and potential environmental constraints and costs. JBSA-Randolph was selected as the preferred alternative and the first installation to undergo recapitalization because it provides the majority of instructor pilot training and is an Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) location. Recapitalizing JBSA-Randolph would serve as an essential first step in establishing a T-7A instructor pilot pipeline and would set the conditions to transition to T-7A training at the other four pilot training installations (DAF 2018).
On January 29, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force approved the preferred sequencing and locations for the next four installations to possibly undergo T-7A recapitalization. Acting on AETC recommendations, the Acting Secretary selected Columbus AFB to be the second installation to be analyzed environmentally for possible recapitalization. Recapitalizing Columbus AFB second would result in the least impact on continued pilot production during the transition between aircraft types, provide the most efficient cost and student production and management plan, and align with AETC's student pipeline flow for the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and IFF curricula. Laughlin, Vance, and Sheppard AFBs would follow as the third, fourth, and fifth installations, respectively (DAF 2021a).","Columbus AFB was selected to be analyzed environmentally as the second installation for possible T-7A recapitalization because it would result in the least impact on continued pilot production during the transition between aircraft types. Additionally, recapitalizing Columbus AFB second provides an efficient cost and student production management plan and aligns well with the Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) student pipeline flow for the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) curricula. This sequencing supports effective training continuity and resource utilization."

Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to habitat loss, shifts in species distributions, and altered reproductive timing, which can further threaten endangered and threatened species.

To address these challenges, several strategies can be adopted:

1. **Updating Critical Habitat Designations**: As climate change alters the landscapes, it might be necessary to re-evaluate and update the designated critical habitats that are essential for the conservation of species.

2. **Climate-Adaptive Management**: Incorporating climate change projections into ESA decision-making processes to anticipate changes in species distributions and habitat conditions. This would involve dynamic management strategies that can adapt to new information and conditions as they arise.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Research**: Improving monitoring of species’ responses to climate change and increasing research on species resilience and adaptation mechanisms to inform management decisions.

4. **Collaboration and Integration**: Working collaboratively across agencies and with non-governmental organizations to integrate climate adaptation strategies into species recovery programs and landscape-level conservation planning.

5. **Policy and Legislative Updates**: Considering amendments to the ESA to specifically address climate change impacts on species and habitats to improve the act's flexibility and effectiveness under changing climatic conditions.

The ESA requires federal agencies, in consultation with USFWS, to ensure that actions they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat of such species. Under the ESA, ""jeopardy"" occurs when an action is reasonably expected, directly or indirectly, to diminish numbers, reproduction, or distribution of a species so that the likelihood of survival and recovery in the wild is appreciably reduced. The ESA defines an ""endangered species"" as any species in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The ESA defines a ""threatened species"" as any species likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future. The ESA also prohibits any action that causes a ""take"" of any listed animal. ""Take"" is defined as, ""to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct."" Listed plants are not protected from take, although it is illegal to collect or maliciously harm them on federal land.
Critical habitat is designated if USFWS determines that the habitat is essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species. Federal agencies must ensure that their activities do not adversely modify designated critical habitat to the point that it would no longer aid in the species' recovery.","The purpose of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is to protect and recover imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend. The Act mandates federal agencies to ensure their actions do not jeopardize the existence of endangered or threatened species, or destroy or adversely modify their critical habitats."
EIS01401,closed,Are floodplains along rivers subject to periodic inundation?,"Floodplains.
Floodplains are low-level areas along rivers, stream channels, large wetlands, or coastal waters. Such lands might be subject to periodic or infrequent inundation due to rain or melting snow. Floodplain ecosystem functions include natural moderation of floods, flood storage and conveyance, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling.
The risk of flooding typically depends on local topography, the frequency of precipitation events, and the size of the watershed above the floodplain. Flood potential is evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which defines 100- and 500-year floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is an area that has a 1 percent chance of inundation by a flood event in a given year, while 500-year floodplains have a 0.2 percent chance of inundation in a given year. Certain facilities inherently pose too great a risk to be in either the 100- or 500-year floodplain, such as hospitals, schools, or storage buildings for irreplaceable records. Federal, state, and local regulations often limit floodplain development to passive uses, such as recreational and preservation activities, to reduce the risks to human health and safety.

1. Updating floodplain management plans to integrate climate projections, ensuring new infrastructure and developments are built with resilience to increased flood risks.
2. Enhancing natural floodplain functions through the preservation and restoration of wetlands and riparian buffers which can absorb excess floodwater.
3. Implementing stricter zoning laws to restrict development in high-risk areas and encouraging relocation from these zones where feasible.
4. Investing in green infrastructure like permeable pavements and rain gardens to reduce runoff and increase water infiltration.

The risk of flooding typically depends on local topography, the frequency of precipitation events, and the size of the watershed above the floodplain. Flood potential is evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which defines 100- and 500-year floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is an area that has a 1 percent chance of inundation by a flood event in a given year, while 500-year floodplains have a 0.2 percent chance of inundation in a given year. Certain facilities inherently pose too great a risk to be in either the 100- or 500-year floodplain, such as hospitals, schools, or storage buildings for irreplaceable records. Federal, state, and local regulations often limit floodplain development to passive uses, such as recreational and preservation activities, to reduce the risks to human health and safety.
EO 11988, Floodplain Management, requires federal agencies to determine whether a proposed action would occur within a floodplain. This determination typically involves review of FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which contain enough general information to determine the relationship of the project area to nearby floodplains. EO 11988 directs federal agencies to avoid floodplains unless the agency determines that no practicable alternative exists. Where the only practicable alternative is to site in a floodplain, the agency should develop measures to reduce and mitigate unavoidable impacts.","If the only practicable alternative is to site a project in a floodplain, agencies must develop measures to reduce and mitigate unavoidable impacts according to Executive Order 11988. These measures should aim to minimize harm to lives, property, and the natural functions of the floodplain."

Irreversible impacts result primarily from use or destruction of a specific resource (e.g., energy and minerals) that cannot be replaced within a reasonable timeframe. The irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources that would result from the Proposed Action involves the consumption of material resources used for construction, energy resources, biological resources, and human labor resources. The use of these resources is considered permanent.
Material Resources. The material resources that would be used for the Proposed Action include concrete, steel, and various construction materials and supplies. The materials that would be consumed are not in short supply, would not limit other unrelated construction activities, and would not be considered significant.
Energy Resources. The energy resources, including petroleum-based products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel), used for the Proposed Action would be irretrievably lost. During construction, gasoline and diesel would be used for the operation of vehicles and construction equipment. Additionally, operation of the T-7A aircraft would require the consumption of aviation fuel. However, the volume of aviation fuel consumed for the T-7A aircraft would not be appreciably different from that consumed for the T-38C. Consumption of these energy resources would not place a significant demand on their availability in the region. Therefore, less than significant impacts would occur.
Biological Resources. The Proposed Action would result in a less than significant loss of vegetation and wildlife habitat. Most of the losses would be lower quality vegetation and habitat on the airfield or in developed portions of the installation and would not include water features. Temporarily disturbed sites would be revegetated with native species to support the native plant community in the long term.
Human Resources. The use of human resources for construction is considered an irretrievable loss only in that it would preclude such personnel from engaging in other work activities. However, the use of human resources for the Proposed Action represents employment opportunities and is considered beneficial.","Given the descriptions in the document, the use of material resources for the proposed action does not warrant concern for future generations regarding their availability and impact. The materials such as concrete, steel, and other construction supplies are not in short supply and their consumption will not significantly limit other construction activities or their availability in the future. Hence, the impact on the availability of material resources for future generations is considered to be insignificant."

Additionally, the construction and ongoing operation could lead to increased air and noise pollution.

The extent and nature of these impacts could vary significantly between locations based on several factors:

1. **Ecosystem Sensitivity and Biodiversity**: Different sites have varying levels of biodiversity and ecosystem sensitivity. For example, sites with more sensitive ecosystems or endangered species could face more severe ecological impacts.

2. **Geological Stability**: The geological conditions of each site could affect the risk of soil contamination and the impact on local water sources. Areas with more porous soil, for instance, might be more vulnerable to contaminants leaching into groundwater.

3. **Existing Infrastructure**: The current level of infrastructure development will influence the environmental impact. Sites requiring extensive new infrastructure could have greater impacts due to the increased need for construction and associated disturbances.

4. **Local Climate**: Variations in local climate conditions can influence the severity of impacts on air and water quality, as well as how the built environment interacts with its surroundings.

5. **Regulatory and Conservation Measures**: Local regulations and conservation efforts can also dictate how much impact a new CIS facility might have, depending on how strictly environmental safeguards are implemented and enforced.

NEPA requires consideration of socioeconomics; specifically, Section 102(A) of NEPA requires federal agencies to ""insure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences...in planning and in decision making"" (42 U.S.C. ¬ß 4332(A)). Socioeconomics refers to a broad, social sciencebased approach to understanding a region's social and economic conditions. It typically includes population, demographic descriptors, economic activity indicators, housing characteristics, property values, and public revenues and expenditures. When applicable, it includes qualitative factors such as community cohesion. Socioeconomics provides important context for analysis of FirstNet projects, as those projects may affect the socioeconomic conditions of a region.
The choice of socioeconomic topics and depth of their treatment depends on the relevance of potential topics to the types of federal actions under consideration. FirstNet's mission is to provide public safety broadband and interoperable emergency communications coverage throughout the nation. Relevant socioeconomic topics include population density and growth, economic activity, housing, property values, and state and local taxes.

If such populations are present, a detailed evaluation should be conducted to assess the potential effects of the construction on these groups, ensuring that any adverse impacts do not disproportionately affect them.

Effective engagement with local communities and stakeholders, including the provision of comprehensive information and consultation processes, is crucial. It would be advisable to involve the impacted communities in the planning and decision-making process through public meetings, workshops, and regular updates to facilitate transparency and address any concerns.

Additionally, mitigation strategies should be developed to reduce negative impacts or enhance positive impacts on the identified populations. Continuous monitoring should be implemented to assess the effectiveness of these strategies and make adjustments as necessary. Furthermore, collaboration with tribal representatives should be maintained to respect and address concerns related to Native American Traditional Values and access, ensuring that any specific issues raised during consultations are promptly and adequately addressed in the environmental impact statement."
EIS01586,recall,What two-step process is used to analyze Environmental Justice populations for impacts according to USEPA guidance?,"Environmental Justice populations are analyzed for impacts based on a two-step process per USEPA guidance. In order to assess the potential for significant environmental justice effects, the socioeconomic characteristics of the area of analysis are first screened for the presence of minority and/or low-income populations. Second, if such populations are found to be present based on USEPA's environmental justice guidance (USEPA 1998), the proposed project and alternatives are evaluated for potential effects that may be expected to disproportionately affect any of the identified populations. Furthermore, per Section 4.8.1.2 of the EIS, under the Proposed Action, NGM would construct the Mount Tenabo access road which would allow continued access to the Cortez Range and to locations within Horse Canyon. This road would provide continued access to Mount Tenabo throughout the life of the Goldrush Mine and following reclamation. Public access through the Horse Canyon PCRI would be limited; however NGM would allow access through Horse Canyon Road upon request of the Tribes for cultural purposes. Impacts to access to the Mount Tenabo/White Cliffs PCRI and Horse Canyon PCRI would be negligible to minor, long-term, and localized.
Although there are several concerns listed here, there are no new specific concerns regarding the project. Tribal coordination is ongoing throughout the NEPA process. Coordination meetings, in addition to consultations letters, and other communications have been held between the BLM and Tribes following Project Initiation as discussed in Section 5.2 of the EIS and in the Native American Traditional Values SER. To date, specific concerns regarding the Proposed Action during the consultation for this Project are identified in the Native American Traditional Values SER and the main issues are covered under the September 2018 PA. Only issues and concerns brought up by tribes are known to the BLM and can be included in the EIS analysis. Impacts to Native American Traditional Values are further discussed throughout several values subsections under Section 4.8 of the EIS.","The two-step process used to analyze Environmental Justice populations for impacts according to USEPA guidance includes: 
1. Screening the socioeconomic characteristics of the area to identify the presence of minority and/or low-income populations.
2. Evaluating the proposed project and alternatives for potential effects that may disproportionately affect any of the identified populations."
