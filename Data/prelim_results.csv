The DFLAW approach will separate and pretreat some of the tank waste (approximately 23.5 million gallons) from certain underground tanks at the Hanford Site and immobilize (vitrify in a glass matrix) the pretreated LAW at the LAW Vitrification Facility. The DFLAW approach is a two-phased approach that will separate and pretreat supernate (essentially the upper-most layer of tank waste that contains low concentrations of long-lived radionuclides) from some of the Hanford tanks, to generate a LAW stream. Phase 1 of the DFLAW approach will entail the following: in-tank settling; separation (removal by decanting) of the supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids); filtration; and then cesium removal using ion exchange columns in a tank-side cesium removal (TSCR) unit.

Phase 1 of the DFLAW approach will entail the following: in-tank settling; separation (removal by decanting) of the supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids); filtration; and then cesium removal using ion exchange columns in a tank-side cesium removal (TSCR) unit. For Phase 2, DOE plans to treat additional supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids) using the same processes and will deploy either an additional TSCR unit or construct a filtration and cesium removal facility. Facilities and equipment necessary to implement the DFLAW approach include: the Effluent Management Facility; a TSCR unit and either an additional TSCR unit or a filtration and cesium removal facility; additional transfer lines; and a storage pad for cesium ion exchange columns (IX Column Storage Pad).

This assumption would result in the highest potential mass of container material (e.g., steel) per unit volume of cargo, thus limiting or reducing the allowable quantity of LLW and MLLW waste to be transported on any given shipment in order to comply with USDOT cargo limits (34,000 pounds for a tandem-axle trailer). The 55-gallon drums (or other USDOT-certified container) would be suitable for transportation in accordance with USDOT requirements and would meet all appropriate USDOT requirements for the transport of the subject wastes to PFNW, in accordance with 49 CFR Subchapter C.","The transportation of these wastes must comply with USDOT requirements, specifically those outlined in 49 CFR Subchapter C.

The TC&WM EIS assumed that three onsite waste management facilities (Central Waste Complex, Waste Receiving and Processing, and Tplant) would be expanded because it was uncertain which facility would ultimately house the grouting capability. This analysis provided a conservative evaluation of potential impacts (e.g., land disturbance, air quality, waste management), since it is highly unlikely that all three facilities would be expanded for this function. The incremental increase in emissions related to the transportation of secondary waste for treatment and disposal would add less than 1 percent to the values presented in the TC&WM EIS.",The incremental increase in emissions related to the transportation of secondary waste for treatment and disposal would add less than 1 percent to the values presented in the TC&WM EIS.

In a Strategic Basing Decision Memorandum for Record dated February 16, 2018, the Secretary of the Air Force identified JBSA-Randolph as the preferred alternative and Columbus, Laughlin, Sheppard, and Vance AFBs as reasonable alternatives for T-7A recapitalization. DAF pilot training relies on a unique runway structure and special use airspace (SUA) capable of supporting high volume pilot training. As such, the potential locations for T-7A aircraft are limited to the five existing pilot training installations. DAF evaluated each of the five installations using criteria that included mission factors (e.g., weather and the ability to meet syllabus requirements), infrastructure capacity, and potential environmental constraints and costs. JBSA-Randolph was selected as the preferred alternative and the first installation to undergo recapitalization because it provides the majority of instructor pilot training and is an Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) location. Recapitalizing JBSA-Randolph would serve as an essential first step in establishing a T-7A instructor pilot pipeline and would set the conditions to transition to T-7A training at the other four pilot training installations (DAF 2018).

To address these challenges, several strategies could be adopted:

1. Incorporating climate change projections into species recovery plans and critical habitat designations to ensure long-term resilience.

2. Prioritizing the protection and restoration of ecosystem connectivity to facilitate species migration and adaptation in response to changing conditions.

3. Enhancing collaboration among federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private landowners, to implement landscape-scale conservation measures that account for climate change impacts.

4. Investing in research to better understand the specific vulnerabilities of imperiled species to climate change and develop targeted conservation strategies.

5. Promoting nature-based solutions, such as wetland restoration and reforestation, that can simultaneously benefit species recovery and mitigate the effects of climate change.

EIS01401,closed,Are floodplains along rivers subject to periodic inundation?,"Floodplains.
Floodplains are low-level areas along rivers, stream channels, large wetlands, or coastal waters. Such lands might be subject to periodic or infrequent inundation due to rain or melting snow. Floodplain ecosystem functions include natural moderation of floods, flood storage and conveyance, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling.
The risk of flooding typically depends on local topography, the frequency of precipitation events, and the size of the watershed above the floodplain. Flood potential is evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which defines 100- and 500-year floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is an area that has a 1 percent chance of inundation by a flood event in a given year, while 500-year floodplains have a 0.2 percent chance of inundation in a given year. Certain facilities inherently pose too great a risk to be in either the 100- or 500-year floodplain, such as hospitals, schools, or storage buildings for irreplaceable records. Federal, state, and local regulations often limit floodplain development to passive uses, such as recreational and preservation activities, to reduce the risks to human health and safety.
EO 11988, Floodplain Management, requires federal agencies to determine whether a proposed action would occur within a floodplain. This determination typically involves review of FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which contain enough general information to determine the relationship of the project area to nearby floodplains.

Floodplains are low-level areas along rivers, stream channels, large wetlands, or coastal waters. Such lands might be subject to periodic or infrequent inundation due to rain or melting snow. Floodplain ecosystem functions include natural moderation of floods, flood storage and conveyance, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling.
The risk of flooding typically depends on local topography, the frequency of precipitation events, and the size of the watershed above the floodplain. Flood potential is evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which defines 100- and 500-year floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is an area that has a 1 percent chance of inundation by a flood event in a given year, while 500-year floodplains have a 0.2 percent chance of inundation in a given year.

Where the only practicable alternative is to site in a floodplain, the agency should develop measures to reduce and mitigate unavoidable impacts.",A 500-year floodplain is an area that has a 0.2 percent chance of being inundated by a flood event in any given year. These floodplains are determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to evaluate flood potential and associated risks.

Irreversible and irretrievable resource commitments are related to the use of non-renewable resources and the impacts that use of these resources would have on future generations. Irreversible impacts result primarily from use or destruction of a specific resource (e.g., energy and minerals) that cannot be replaced within a reasonable timeframe.

In addition, before conducting any activity in the PCRI areas, NGM notifies BLM of the proposed activity so that BLM may establish exclusion zones as necessary to protect the features identified as contributing elements in the April 19, 2004 eligibility determinations for the PCRI areas. For any activity conducted outside of the exclusion zones, NGM arranges for a BLM qualified archaeologist and a Native American observer to be on site during new surface disturbing activity to ensure that contributing elements are not adversely affected by the operations.","The inclusion of Native American perspectives in decision-making processes for culturally and religiously important lands could lead to more holistic and respectful management approaches. By actively engaging with tribes and considering their traditional knowledge, values, and concerns, land management agencies can develop strategies that honor the cultural significance of these areas while still allowing for responsible use. This collaborative approach may help build trust, reduce conflicts, and ensure the long-term preservation of sites that are deeply meaningful to Native American communities."

First, conduct a thorough socioeconomic analysis of the affected area to identify the presence of any minority or low-income populations, per EPA environmental justice guidelines. 

If such populations are identified, carefully evaluate the project's potential impacts that could disproportionately affect these vulnerable groups. This should include robust community outreach and consultation to understand and document specific concerns.

Develop targeted mitigation measures to minimize any disproportionate adverse impacts. This could include modifying road alignment, providing alternative access routes, establishing community benefit agreements, or other context-appropriate solutions arrived at collaboratively with the impacted populations.

Maintain proactive, transparent and inclusive communication and engagement with the affected communities throughout the project lifecycle to build trust, understand evolving concerns, and adapt mitigation approaches as needed.
