The DFLAW approach will separate and pretreat some of the tank waste (approximately 23.5 million gallons) from certain underground tanks at the Hanford Site and immobilize (vitrify in a glass matrix) the pretreated LAW at the LAW Vitrification Facility. The DFLAW approach is a two-phased approach that will separate and pretreat supernate (essentially the upper-most layer of tank waste that contains low concentrations of long-lived radionuclides) from some of the Hanford tanks, to generate a LAW stream. Phase 1 of the DFLAW approach will entail the following: in-tank settling; separation (removal by decanting) of the supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids); filtration; and then cesium removal using ion exchange columns in a tank-side cesium removal (TSCR) unit. For Phase 2, DOE plans to treat additional supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids) using the same processes and will deploy either an additional TSCR unit or construct a filtration and cesium removal facility.

The DFLAW approach is a two-phased approach that will separate and pretreat supernate (essentially the upper-most layer of tank waste that contains low concentrations of long-lived radionuclides) from some of the Hanford tanks, to generate a LAW stream. Phase 1 of the DFLAW approach will entail the following: in-tank settling; separation (removal by decanting) of the supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids); filtration; and then cesium removal using ion exchange columns in a tank-side cesium removal (TSCR) unit. For Phase 2, DOE plans to treat additional supernate (including dissolved saltcake and interstitial liquids) using the same processes and will deploy either an additional TSCR unit or construct a filtration and cesium removal facility. Facilities and equipment necessary to implement the DFLAW approach include: the Effluent Management Facility; a TSCR unit and either an additional TSCR unit or a filtration and cesium removal facility; additional transfer lines; and a storage pad for cesium ion exchange columns (IX Column Storage Pad). DOE prepared a supplement analysis of the TC&WM EIS (EIS-0391-SA-02; DOE 2019), which evaluated the DFLAW approach. DOE published an amended ROD (84 FR 424; January 28, 2019) to include construction and operation of the IX Column Storage Pad to support implementation of the DFLAW approach.","Phase 2 of the DFLAW approach may potentially incorporate a filtration and cesium removal facility.

EIS01192,process,How does the increase in offsite shipments of secondary waste from the Hanford Site to PFNW affect daily truck loads?,"The offsite shipments of secondary waste would result in a slight increase in traffic between the Hanford Site and PFNW. With approximately 2,200 additional shipments annually (mostly between Hanford and PFNW, with a small subset exiting the Benton County area for WCS or DSSI), the daily truck loads could increase by approximately six to eight per day. While this increased truck traffic would increase the potential noise in the area immediately south of the Hanford Site, there would not be large numbers of trucks transporting waste at the same time. Each incremental truck shipment would contribute small increases in noise, which would dissipate quickly. It would not be discernible from the existing truck and vehicle traffic noise.",The increase in offsite shipments of secondary waste would result in an additional six to eight truck loads per day.

The transportation of secondary waste by truck to offsite treatment facilities and from the treatment facilities to a disposal site would generate vehicle emission pollutants, including GHG. Potential air quality emissions were evaluated in the TC&WM EIS (Appendix G) for each alternative for the construction, operation, deactivation, and closure project phases.22 These evaluations did not include offsite transportation of waste for treatment and disposal. To estimate the relative contribution of air emissions that include offsite transportation of secondary waste for treatment and disposal, DOE compared the transportation emissions of CO, nitrogen oxides, and GHGs to similar emissions for Tank Closure Alternative 2B during operations.","The potential emissions of criteria and toxic air pollutants associated with waste management locations are evaluated through a comprehensive analysis in the environmental impact statement. This evaluation includes emissions from construction, operation, and deactivation phases. The assessment covers expanded facilities to provide a conservative estimate of potential impacts. Detailed emissions data for criteria pollutants, toxic air pollutants, and greenhouse gases are presented in tables within the document's appendices. The analysis also considers emissions from transportation activities related to waste management operations."

The Proposed Action would not involve the construction or operation of any facilities that have not been evaluated previously under NEPA or existing facilities that have not been licensed and permitted for air emissions by the applicable state regulatory agency. Therefore, the Proposed Action would not involve any new sources of facility air emissions at the Hanford Site, the offsite commercial treatment facilities, or any commercial disposal facilities. As identified in Section 2.1 of this SA, the TC&WM EIS assumed (under all alternatives) that the three onsite waste management locations (Central Waste Complex, Waste Receiving and Processing, and T-plant) were all expanded to provide a conservative evaluation of potential impacts since it was uncertain which facility would ultimately house the capability to treat and store all secondary waste.

EIS01214,closed,Does the transportation safety of LLW and MLLW directly depend on the external dose rates of the waste packages?,"Proper packaging is a key element in transportation safety, and the selection of appropriate packaging typically is based on the level and form of radioactivity inherent to the materials that are being shipped. LLW and MLLW must be packaged to protect workers and the public (as well as the environment) during transport due to potential radiological exposures of truck crews and the public being directly dependent upon external dose rates associated with the waste packages.24 Solid and liquid secondary LLW and MLLW to be shipped offsite for treatment and stabilization are expected to have low levels of radioactivity. This is substantiated by the following considerations: (1) the WM PEIS (from which this SA's dose-rate estimates are scaled) conservatively assumed a generically representative dose rate of 1 mrem per hour at 1 meter for all LLW and MLLW packages; (2) recent historical (2-year) measured dose-rate data for LLW and MLLW packages shipped from the Hanford Site exhibited quantities that are comparable to, but smaller than (i.e., on the order of 0.5 mrem per hour at 1 meter) the WM PEIS's general estimate of 1 mrem per hour in the vast majority (i.e., greater than 97 percent) of cases (WRPS 2022b); and (3) MicroShield calculations performed for EMF-concentrate have shown that associated shipping containers (""supertainers"") for liquid MLLW would have an expected dose rate of approximately 0.63 mrem per hour at 2 meters and approximately 9 mrem per hour on contact (WRPS 2022c).

It is furthermore noteworthy to emphasize that since these Group 3 supertainer shipments would only account for about onethird of the proposed total shipping-miles (e.g., roughly 36 percent for truck crews) for all secondary waste groups evaluated in this SA, that the preponderance of Group 1 and 2 wastes that will be expected to exhibit dose rates in the 0.5 mrem per hour range (at 1 meter) would resultantly bring the overall weighted dose-rate average for the entire collective cadre of shipments down to near the 1 mrem per hour (at 1 meter) mark, which is consistent with the WM PEIS's representative estimate.","The dose rates for solid and liquid secondary LLW and MLLW shipped offsite are generally lower than or comparable to the 1 mrem per hour at 1 meter assumed in the WM PEIS. Recent Hanford Site data shows most shipments at about 0.5 mrem per hour at 1 meter. MicroShield calculations for EMF-concentrate shipping containers indicate higher rates of approximately 2.5 mrem per hour at 1 meter, but these represent only about one-third of total shipments.

EIS01245,funnel,How does the assumption about the container type affect the allowable quantity of LLW and MLLW waste per shipment?,"Impact Assessment
For Group 1 waste (see Tables 2-1 and 2-2), the analysis in this SA conservatively estimates that approximately 7.7 cubic meters of solid LLW and MLLW or 15 cubic meters(approximately 4,000 gallons) liquid LLW and MLLW could be shipped from the Hanford Site to the PFNW facility (approximately 26 miles) in a single truck shipment. DOE used a conservative assumption that all such wastes (solid or liquid) would be transported in USDOT-certified 55-gallon drums, which would maximize the number of shipments. This assumption would result in the highest potential mass of container material (e.g., steel) per unit volume of cargo, thus limiting or reducing the allowable quantity of LLW and MLLW waste to be transported on any given shipment in order to comply with USDOT cargo limits (34,000 pounds for a tandem-axle trailer). The 55-gallon drums (or other USDOT-certified container) would be suitable for transportation in accordance with USDOT requirements and would meet all appropriate USDOT requirements for the transport of the subject wastes to PFNW, in accordance with 49 CFR Subchapter C.","The assumption of using 55-gallon drums as the container type results in a more conservative estimate of allowable waste quantity per shipment. This approach maximizes the number of shipments and the mass of container material relative to waste volume. Consequently, it reduces the amount of LLW and MLLW that can be transported in a single shipment while staying within USDOT cargo weight limits.

This analysis provided a conservative evaluation of potential impacts (e.g., land disturbance, air quality, waste management), since it is highly unlikely that all three facilities would be expanded for this function. The incremental increase in emissions related to the transportation of secondary waste for treatment and disposal would add less than 1 percent to the values presented in the TC&WM EIS.","The TC&WM EIS assumed a conservative approach by evaluating the potential expansion of three onsite waste management facilities - the Central Waste Complex, Waste Receiving and Processing, and T-plant.

In a Strategic Basing Decision Memorandum for Record dated February 16, 2018, the Secretary of the Air Force identified JBSA-Randolph as the preferred alternative and Columbus, Laughlin, Sheppard, and Vance AFBs as reasonable alternatives for T-7A recapitalization. DAF pilot training relies on a unique runway structure and special use airspace (SUA) capable of supporting high volume pilot training. As such, the potential locations for T-7A aircraft are limited to the five existing pilot training installations. DAF evaluated each of the five installations using criteria that included mission factors (e.g., weather and the ability to meet syllabus requirements), infrastructure capacity, and potential environmental constraints and costs. JBSA-Randolph was selected as the preferred alternative and the first installation to undergo recapitalization because it provides the majority of instructor pilot training and is an Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) location. Recapitalizing JBSA-Randolph would serve as an essential first step in establishing a T-7A instructor pilot pipeline and would set the conditions to transition to T-7A training at the other four pilot training installations (DAF 2018).
On January 29, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force approved the preferred sequencing and locations for the next four installations to possibly undergo T-7A recapitalization. Acting on AETC recommendations, the Acting Secretary selected Columbus AFB to be the second installation to be analyzed environmentally for possible recapitalization.

EIS01401,closed,Are floodplains along rivers subject to periodic inundation?,"Floodplains.
Floodplains are low-level areas along rivers, stream channels, large wetlands, or coastal waters. Such lands might be subject to periodic or infrequent inundation due to rain or melting snow. Floodplain ecosystem functions include natural moderation of floods, flood storage and conveyance, groundwater recharge, and nutrient cycling.
The risk of flooding typically depends on local topography, the frequency of precipitation events, and the size of the watershed above the floodplain. Flood potential is evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which defines 100- and 500-year floodplains. The 100-year floodplain is an area that has a 1 percent chance of inundation by a flood event in a given year, while 500-year floodplains have a 0.2 percent chance of inundation in a given year. Certain facilities inherently pose too great a risk to be in either the 100- or 500-year floodplain, such as hospitals, schools, or storage buildings for irreplaceable records. Federal, state, and local regulations often limit floodplain development to passive uses, such as recreational and preservation activities, to reduce the risks to human health and safety.
EO 11988, Floodplain Management, requires federal agencies to determine whether a proposed action would occur within a floodplain. This determination typically involves review of FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which contain enough general information to determine the relationship of the project area to nearby floodplains.

Biological Resources. The Proposed Action would result in a less than significant loss of vegetation and wildlife habitat. Most of the losses would be lower quality vegetation and habitat on the airfield or in developed portions of the installation and would not include water features. Temporarily disturbed sites would be revegetated with native species to support the native plant community in the long term.
Human Resources. The use of human resources for construction is considered an irretrievable loss only in that it would preclude such personnel from engaging in other work activities. However, the use of human resources for the Proposed Action represents employment opportunities and is considered beneficial.","The construction phase presents several opportunities to innovate in reducing resource consumption:

1. Utilizing recycled or sustainable building materials to minimize the use of new resources.

2. Implementing energy-efficient construction methods and equipment to reduce fuel consumption.

3. Optimizing construction schedules and logistics to minimize transportation and equipment use.

4. Employing water conservation techniques during construction activities.

5. Incorporating waste reduction and recycling programs throughout the building process.

6. Using locally sourced materials to decrease transportation-related resource consumption.

7. Implementing green building design principles to enhance long-term resource efficiency.

8. Exploring innovative construction technologies that require fewer resources or have a lower environmental impact.

These approaches can significantly reduce the overall resource footprint of the construction phase while potentially introducing cost savings and environmental benefits."
EIS01433,evaluation,How does the evaluation of energy resource consumption in the proposed action justify the less than significant impact on regional availability?,"3.12.1 Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources
Irreversible and irretrievable resource commitments are related to the use of non-renewable resources and the impacts that use of these resources would have on future generations. Irreversible impacts result primarily from use or destruction of a specific resource (e.g., energy and minerals) that cannot be replaced within a reasonable timeframe. The irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources that would result from the Proposed Action involves the consumption of material resources used for construction, energy resources, biological resources, and human labor resources. The use of these resources is considered permanent.
Material Resources. The material resources that would be used for the Proposed Action include concrete, steel, and various construction materials and supplies. The materials that would be consumed are not in short supply, would not limit other unrelated construction activities, and would not be considered significant.
Energy Resources. The energy resources, including petroleum-based products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel), used for the Proposed Action would be irretrievably lost. During construction, gasoline and diesel would be used for the operation of vehicles and construction equipment. Additionally, operation of the T-7A aircraft would require the consumption of aviation fuel. However, the volume of aviation fuel consumed for the T-7A aircraft would not be appreciably different from that consumed for the T-38C.

It concludes that the volume of aviation fuel consumed would not differ appreciably, and therefore would not place a significant demand on regional energy resources. This assessment, coupled with the consideration of temporary construction-related fuel use, supports the determination that the impact on regional energy availability would be less than significant."

Furthermore, per Section 4.8.1.2 of the EIS, under the Proposed Action, NGM would construct the Mount Tenabo access road which would allow continued access to the Cortez Range and to locations within Horse Canyon. This road would provide continued access to Mount Tenabo throughout the life of the Goldrush Mine and following reclamation. Public access through the Horse Canyon PCRI would be limited; however NGM would allow access through Horse Canyon Road upon request of the Tribes for cultural purposes. Impacts to access to the Mount Tenabo/White Cliffs PCRI and Horse Canyon PCRI would be negligible to minor, long-term, and localized.
Although there are several concerns listed here, there are no new specific concerns regarding the project. Tribal coordination is ongoing throughout the NEPA process. Coordination meetings, in addition to consultations letters, and other communications have been held between the BLM and Tribes following Project Initiation as discussed in Section 5.2 of the EIS and in the Native American Traditional Values SER. To date, specific concerns regarding the Proposed Action during the consultation for this Project are identified in the Native American Traditional Values SER and the main issues are covered under the September 2018 PA. Only issues and concerns brought up by tribes are known to the BLM and can be included in the EIS analysis. Impacts to Native American Traditional Values are further discussed throughout several values subsections under Section 4.8 of the EIS.","To better engage and address concerns of tribes and environmental justice populations, the following strategies could be employed:

1. Implement earlier and more frequent consultation meetings throughout the planning process.

2. Develop a cultural resource management plan in collaboration with tribal representatives.

3. Establish a formal tribal advisory committee to provide ongoing input and feedback.

4. Conduct targeted outreach to environmental justice communities using culturally appropriate methods and languages.

5. Offer capacity-building workshops to help stakeholders effectively participate in the review process.

6. Create a dedicated liaison position to facilitate communication between parties.

7. Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge into environmental assessments.

8. Provide transparent and accessible information on potential impacts and mitigation measures.

9. Establish a grievance mechanism for addressing concerns post-approval.

10. Conduct regular site visits with tribal and community representatives during project implementation.

These approaches can help foster trust, improve communication, and ensure more comprehensive consideration of diverse perspectives throughout the process."
EIS01585,problem-solving, how would you address the potential environmental justice concerns for minority and/or low-income populations impacted by the construction of the Mount Tenabo access road?,"Environmental Justice populations are analyzed for impacts based on a two-step process per USEPA guidance.

1. Conduct a thorough screening process to identify any minority or low-income populations in the affected area.

2. If such populations are present, evaluate the project for any disproportionate effects on these communities.

3. Ensure ongoing consultation and communication with affected tribes and community representatives throughout the planning and construction process.

4. Maintain open access to culturally significant areas where possible, and establish clear protocols for requesting access when restrictions are necessary.

5. Implement mitigation measures to minimize any negative impacts on identified vulnerable populations.

6. Continuously monitor and assess the project's effects on these communities during and after construction.

7. Be prepared to adjust plans or implement additional measures if unforeseen impacts arise.

This approach aims to balance project needs with environmental justice considerations in a fair and transparent manner."
